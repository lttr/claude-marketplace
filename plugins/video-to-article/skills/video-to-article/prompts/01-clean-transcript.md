# Prompt: Clean Transcript

Convert the following transcript into a more readable form by dividing it into paragraphs and adding headings.

**Important instructions:**

- Do not change the content, except for obvious typos
- Do not change the tone of voice - if the speaker uses informal language, keep it
- Remove filler words like "Eh", "Ehm", "Um", "Uh"
- Remove comments related to the transcription itself, or rewrite them elegantly if possible
  - For example: "(laughter)" or "(2 second pause)"
- **Respond in {lang} language** - maintain the same language as the original transcript

The cleaned transcript should preserve the speaker's authentic voice while being easier to read and follow.
