description: Grilling session that challenges your plan against the existing domain model, sharpens terminology, and updates documentation (GLOSSARY.md, ADRs) inline as decisions crystallise. Use when user wants to stress-test a plan against their project's language and documented decisions.
---

<what-to-do>

Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. Map it as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled — the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for my answers before the next round.

Format each question like so:

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, may be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Each round of answers reshapes the tree — settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never mine. When a frontier question needs a fact from the codebase, the docs, or the environment, dispatch a subagent to find it rather than asking me. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait — ask the rest of the frontier now. The _decisions_ are mine — put each one to me and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on the plan until I confirm we have reached a shared understanding.

## Domain awareness

During codebase exploration, also look for existing documentation:

### File structure

Most repos have a single glossary:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple glossaries. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── GLOSSARY.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── GLOSSARY.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily — only when you have something to write. If no `GLOSSARY.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

### Other docs

A repo often has more markdown than `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs — design notes, architecture overviews, runbooks, RFCs, often under `docs/`. Don't read them wholesale; that burns context. Instead, when a grilling question touches a topic, `rg` the docs for the relevant terms and read only the hits. Treat what you find as context to challenge against, not law — only `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs are authoritative. If a doc contradicts the plan, surface it like any other conflict.

## During the session

### Challenge against the language

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `GLOSSARY.md`, call it out immediately. "Your language defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y — which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account' — do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible — which is right?"

### Update GLOSSARY.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `GLOSSARY.md` right there. Don't batch these up — capture them as they happen. Use the format in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md`.

Keep it devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `GLOSSARY.md` as a spec or scratch pad — it holds canonical terms and nothing else; everything else lives in ADRs or code.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/ADR-FORMAT.md`.
